                <p>This week we covered a major feature of any GIS that helps you modify data: geoprocessing.</p>

                <h2>Part 1: Geoprocessing</h2>
                <p>Geoprocessing tools give you the means to overlay multiple vector layers in order to modify the layers and potentially combine them. You are most likely going to find the following geoprocessing functions to be the most useful:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>clipping</li>
                    <li>buffers</li>
                    <li>difference</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Buffers can be especially useful when talking about <em>proximity</em>, and you'll probably find these useful in the following assignment from your council member:</p>
                <div style="background: #ddd; padding: 15px;">
                    <p>Hi GIS pro,</p>
                    <p>The group in our district arguing for safer streets is looking for more detail about <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95">motor vehicle collisions</a> for the past year. I was thinking we could either highlight the collisions near <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Point-Locations/jfju-ynrr">schools</a> or <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bicycle-Routes/7vsa-caz7">bike lanes</a>. I trust you to pick the one you find most illuminating. In addition to highlighting these collisions I'd like to answer these questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What percentage of the crashes in our district happened near schools or bike lanes (again, your choice)?</li>
                        <li>How many injuries and deaths happened as a result of these crashes?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thanks for all your help!</p>
                </div>
                <p>Buffer the schools (I'd start with 500 feet) or bike lanes (I'd start with 25 feet) and use Select by Location to find the collisions in those buffers. You're free to re-use the collisions data you downloaded for the previous assignment, in addition to other map elements as they're useful.</p>
                <p>As there is only one map this week and we covered some other QGIS features in the beginning of class on Tuesday (select by location, labels, legends), I am looking to see you focusing on the nuances of your map. Try out some of these features we talked about in class and see how far you can take them.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
                <p>Include <strong>a PDF or image export</strong> for Part 1.</p>
                <p>Finally, include a <strong>short summary</strong> (1/2 page) of what you did for this assignment. Explain what you created and how you did so. What did you have problems with? What did you enjoy? What would you like to know how to do next?</p>
