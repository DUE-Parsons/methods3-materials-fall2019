                <p>Be careful: some of the online resources that exist for Carto use an older interface (CartoDB). Start with <a href="https://carto.com/help/tutorials/your-account/">the official tutorials</a> and post on the Google Group with questions.</p>

                <h2>Part 1: Make a shareable map in Carto</h2>
                <p>Your boss the city council member is back at it again:</p>
                <div style="background: #ddd; padding: 15px;">
                    <p>Hi map wizard,</p>
                    <p>It's been a few weeks! We now have access to some kind of mapping website called Carto and I was wondering if you could put one of our maps from earlier in it. It's okay if the styles are a bit different, but I'd like to be able to share it online with constituents. Ideally I'd like to see the vehicle collisions near bike lanes or schools, but if there is a map you made for us that you think would work better here I'm open to it.</p>
                    <p>Thanks!</p>
                </div>
                <p>Create a map in Carto using at least two layers of data. I suggest using the data from <a title="Assignment 4: QGIS geoprocessing" href="https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1460477/assignments/7358560" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.newschool.edu/api/v1/courses/1407316/assignments/6483369" data-api-returntype="Assignment">Assignment 4, part 1</a> as requested above, but if you no longer have the data you do not have to re-create it. If you are not working with the data from Assignment 4, I suggest using a layer of polygon data and a layer of point data.</p>
                <p>Share the map publicly and submit the link to your map.</p>

                <h2>Part 2: Make something related to your project in Carto</h2>
                <p>You've been collecting data for your <a title="Final Project" href="https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1460477/assignments/7295378">final project</a>--use this as an opportunity to try to represent some of it with an online map. It doesn't have to be all of the data for your project or necessarily on the same theme as your project, but try using data in the geographic area of your project to make an online map. Share the map publicly and submit a link to it.</p>
                <h2><span style="color: #000000;">Submitting your work</span></h2>
                <p><span style="color: #000000;">Please submit the <strong>two public links</strong> to your maps along with a short description of what you did.<strong><br /></strong></span></p>
