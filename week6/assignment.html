                <h2>Part 1: Visualizing many points</h2>
                <div style="background: #ddd; padding: 15px;">
                    <p>Hi again map-maker,</p>
                    <p>There are two aspects of the district we are trying to get a grasp on, but the issues are so large that we're not even sure where to start. Can you help us understand how dense the district is with one of these and how that density varies throughout the area?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Airbnb listings. I think you can find them at <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">Inside Airbnb</a>.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/pi5s-9p35#Export">Street trees</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As usual, it would help to see some streets and other landmarks for context.</p>
                    <p>Thank you!</p>
                </div>
                <p>Pick the <em>one</em> of the ways we've looked at mapping many points--heat maps or hex bins--to help your council member understand the density of <em>one</em> of these point datasets:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">Inside Airbnb</a> (scroll down to New York City and download <strong>listings.csv</strong>)</li>

                <h2>Part 2: Carto</h2>
                <p>Next week we will start looking at Carto. The New School has an agreement with the company that lets us give more space to students as needed. To take advantage of this, please create a login with your New School email address using <a class="external" href="https://thenewschool.carto.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a> if you haven't already.</p>
                <p>If you already have a Carto account with your New School email address and the above link does not work as a result, please login to your existing account and change the email address associated with it, then try signing up again.</p>
                <p>You don't have to do anything else with Carto for now, we will start talking about it next week.</p>

                <h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
                <p>For Part 1, use a QGIS <strong>Print Layout</strong> to create <strong>a PDF or image</strong>. Make sure to add map accessories such as legends, titles, and scale bars as appropriate. Refer to your sources as appropriate. You don't need to submit anything for Part 2.</p>
                <p>Finally, include a <strong>short summary</strong> of what you did for this assignment. Explain what you created and how you did so. What did you have problems with? What did you enjoy? What would you like to know how to do next?</p>
