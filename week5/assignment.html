                <h2>Census Data Joins</h2>
                <p>When you <em>join</em> two or more datasets, you combine them feature-by-feature, and this often gives attributes to a feature that it would not have otherwise had.</p>
                <p><strong>Attribute joins</strong> add attributes to features based on a <strong>unique identifier</strong>. Often you will have a spatial dataset (such as a shapefile) and a CSV file with extra data that you would like to map. As long as both the spatial data and the CSV have a common unique identifier (sometimes this is a name, but it could be a unique number or an address) you can join them in QGIS and add the data from the CSV to the spatial data.</p>
                <p>Use attribute joins to help your council member with the following:</p>
                <div style="background: #ddd; padding: 15px;">
                    <p>Hi again map-maker,</p>
                    <p>Now that you're getting settled in, we'd like to get a better look at our council district using census data. In particular, let's start with <strong>renter occupancy</strong> or <strong>median household income</strong> (your choice) by census tract. Make the focus our district, but please show the surrounding area, too, for context.</p>
                    <p>Thanks as always!</p>
                </div>
                <p>Download census data using <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/">American FactFinder</a>, join with the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_tracts.html">census tracts</a>, and make a choropleth map with some of the joined data. Choose which data to get:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>renter vs owner occupancy
